.SH SYNOPSIS
.B aftermath
TRACE_FILE [EXECUTABLE [VISUALS]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Aftermath is a program for trace visualization and analysis of
task-parallel programs and run-time systems.

TRACE_FILE is the trace file to be opened by Aftermath. This may be
any trace file in Aftermath's format (usually ending with .ost) and
may be compressed using GZIP, BZIP2, or XZ.

If EXECUTABLE is specified, Aftermath attempts to read the symbol
table from the file and uses this information in the visualization.

VISUALS may be a file that contains annotations created earlier with
Aftermath.
