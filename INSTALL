Aftermath uses the GNU Autotools for compilation and installation. If
you have cloned the sources from the public git repository, you first
need to generate the build scripts by executing the bootstrap script:

  $ ./bootstrap

The package is configured with the well-known configure script. For
the default installation path and parameters simply execute
"configure":

  $ ./configure

This script also reports if any of the required software packages is
missing on your system. For more options please refer to INSTALL.GNU
or execute:

  $ ./configure --help

Once all required packages are installed and Aftermath is configured
you may proceed with the build process:

  $ make

It is highly recommended that you run the unit tests shipped with the
sources by executing:

  $ make check

The installation is carried out by the "install" target of the make
file. If Aftermath has been configured to be installed into a system
path this step requires root privileges. On many systems this can be
achieved by spawning a shell with super user privileges (e.g., su) or
by executing the command through sudo:

  $ su
  # make install

    or

  $ sudo make install

If you install Aftermath to a non-standard location do not forget to
add the path containing Aftermath's executable to the PATH environment
variable.
