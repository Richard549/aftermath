WHAT IS AFTERMATH?

  Aftermath is a tool for the visualization and analysis of execution
  traces of parallel programs. Currently, Aftermath supports
  OpenStream and OpenMP. The tool is designed for the interactive
  exploration of traces with immediate, qualitative and quantitative
  feedback.

  The tool is able to visualized key metrics and indicators, such as
  task duration, state information, hardware performance counter
  values and data exchanges jointly, aggregated and related to the
  machine's topology. The tool supports traces of up to several
  gigabytes, with fast and intuitive navigation and on-line generation
  of new derived metrics.
